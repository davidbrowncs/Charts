## Graphs 
The aim of this project is to provide charting capabilities in Java - Swing.
Currently it is nowhere near finished, and is very rough around the edges.
As I work on this project further I will be adding documentation.
Currently the types of charts available are a line chart and a scatter chart. There is also a line chart with the area under the line filled in.
The aim is to provide a good looking, and also fairly accurate charting framework.
